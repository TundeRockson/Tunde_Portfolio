# [Project 1: Predicting Soccer Players' Transfer Value](https://github.com/TundeRockson/Tunde_Portfolio/blob/main/Soccer%20Proj/Soccer%20Project.ipynb)
In this project, I predicted soccer players' transfer values in order to determine which players are overvalued and undervalued and Scraped data from a soccer video game dataset and built regression models in order to predict what a player's market value will be and compared it to the actual market value

# [Project 3: Moneyball](https://github.com/TundeRockson/Tunde_Portfolio/blob/main/Moneyball/Moneyball%20Project.ipynb)
In this project, I applied data wrangling and exploratory data analysis skills to baseball data. In particular, I want to understand how efficient teams have been historically at spending money and getting wins in return.
